# Computer Dot Files
The goal of these dot files is to provide the optimal computing experience for Mac OS X and Ubuntu. 
These are all of the config files that I use on my development machine. 

# Getting Started
It is important to clone this repo to the right location. It must be in
`.dot-files` in your home directory. 

```
git clone https://github.com/ASzot/Dot-Files.git ~/.dot-files
```

Run `sh update.sh` to install all of the configurations. Reload your zsh. If you are installing a new system read the mac environment setup or the ubuntu environment setup.

For older versions of tmux, copy the old tmux conf file. 

## Commands
Shortcuts are defined in `.zshrc`. They are listed here: 
* `creategit`: Create a GitHub deploy key. Note that when cloning you specify
  the project name as the host instead of git@github.com. So if you named the
  public key `myproj` and the project was at github.com/aszot/project, notice
  they don't have to match, you would clone with `git clone myproj:aszot/project.git`.
* `upme`: Fetch settings from github and apply them. 
* `sa`: Switch to the specified conda environment. 
* `rs`: Reload zshrc.
* `py`: Alias for `python`. 
* `cw`: Kill all tmux windows except for the current one. 
* `nv`: Alias for `nvidia-smi`
* `sfor`: Alias for `ps aux | grep` to search for a process. 

## Scripts
* `push.sh`: Pushes the current settings from the machine into the repository.
* `pull.sh`: Pulls the current settings from the GitHub repository and puts them on the Ubuntu machine.
* `create_gh_key.sh`: Script for automatically configuring GitHub keys. 
* `first_pull.sh`: Pulls all settings from repo to local machine and also pulls
  additional files such as SSH config that should only be pulled once as they
  will be overwritten.

### Vim Usage
There are a couple of things that need to be configured for vim usage. You need
to pip install a couple of things. Activate the Python environment you will be
using for Vim development. Then run `sh vim_setup.sh`.

#### Server (with gpu for deep learning)
Run `sh ubuntu_16_04_server_fresh_part_1.sh` then restart the computer then run `sh ubuntu_16_04_server_fresh_part_2.sh`. You also probably want to set up the default bashrc. `sudo vim /etc/skel/.bashrc` and add `export PATH=/opt/conda/bin:$PATH`.

#### Regular
Run `sh ubuntu_16_04_fresh.sh`
