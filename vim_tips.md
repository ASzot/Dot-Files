# VIM TIPS

Here are a collections of vim commands that I find useful in my setup.

* Working with LaTeX files:
  * `VimtexCompile` to start the automatic vim preview process. This will even
    automatically open up the Skim app for previewing. 
  * `zg` to ignore a certain word for spell check.
  * `ctrl-x + ctrl-o` for autocomplete for references using Vimtex.
* Moving around quickly with vim
  * ctrl-o, ctrl-i to move forward and backward in file history
* Change the capitialization of an entire word `g~w`
