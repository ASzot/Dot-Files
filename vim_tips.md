# VIM TIPS

Here are a collections of vim commands that I find useful in my setup.

* Working with LaTeX files:
  * `:LLPStartPreview` begin live preview of `.tex` file.
* Moving around quickly with vim
  * ctrl-o, ctrl-i to move forward and backward in file history
* Change the capitialization of an entire word `g~w`
